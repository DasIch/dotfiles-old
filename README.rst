My vim configuration
====================

This is my vim configuration, my vimrc, plugins, snippets, syntax files and
the colorscheme I use, everything is here. Feel free to look around and
steal what you like, everything should be commented so that you don't have
to guess what it does.

Installation
------------

`make install`

	Installs the configuration overwriting a previous one.

`clean-all`
	
	Deletes the current configuration as well as any build files.
